Hi, my name is Karen. I live in Boise, Idaho USA
I’m currently learning cloud technologies and upping my IT game.
I've been a DBA and an IT Production Support Engineer for years, supporting complex billing systems. Now, it's time to leap into the cloud.
I am currently learning Azure, GitHub, GitLab, Python, JSON, APIs, REST, Kubernetes, Postman and Docker.
